# Radium

Radium is a toolchain for handling modifiers, states, computed styles and
responsive styles for react component styling. It allows you to handle complex
component styling in a declarative, easy to write way. Component styling in
React provides a number of benefits over traditional CSS:

- Scoped styles, meaning no more global variables
- Avoids specificity conflicts
- Source order independence
- Dead code elimination
- Highly expressive
