# Radium Changelog

## 0.23.0 (March 15, 2018)
- Support ES7 arrow functions for React class methods. (#738)

## 0.22.1 (March 1, 2018)
- Fix `keyframes` bug from prefixed inline styles. (#973)

## 0.22.0 (February 9, 2018)
### Breaking Changes
- Radium now exports defaults as `.default`, so for runtimes like Node.js for all files in `lib/**`. We have changed `package.json:main` to point to `/index.js` instead of `/lib/index.js` as a convenience wrapper to expose mostly what was there before so behavior of `const Radium = require('radium');` works mostly as it did before. Caveats:
    - When using webpack2+ to build code with `require('radium')` in it you will need to change that to become `require('radium').default`.
    - Any imports of a default export from a file in lib like `const Enhancer = require('radium/lib/enhancer');` will need to be changed to `const Enhancer = require('radium/lib/enhancer').default;`.
    - We have a full examples repository of how imports work in all likely scenarios that should come up. https://github.com/FormidableLabs/radium-experiments-v0.22

## 0.16.6 (February 9, 2016)

### Bug Fixes

## 0.16.5 (January 27, 2016)

### Bug Fixes
- Don't merge media query styles, fixes #550
- Don't add className if empty, fixes #539

### Improvements
- Passing `'all'` as the `userAgent` will add all prefixes, useful for caching server-rendered pages, thanks @oliviertassinari (this applies to inline styles and style rendered as CSS, but does not yet include adding all the prefixed versions of `keyframes`)
- Add support for `:visited` styles:
```jsx
const url = 'https://github.com/formidablelabs/radium';
const VisitedLink = Radium(() =>
  <a href={url} style={{color: 'gray', ':visited': {color: 'black'}}}>{url}</a>
);
```

## 0.16.4 (January 23, 2016)

### Bug Fixes
- Add `px` suffix if needed *before* prefixing, since the list in `appendPxIfNeeded` does not include prefixed variants
- Radium now calls `toString` on values itself, instead of relying on `inline-style-prefixer` or React to do so (they don't)

### Improvements
- Much lighter `npm install radium` by removing `babel` & co from `dependencies` before publishing
- Radium now ignores children or props that are themselves Radium enhanced components, for a nice perf gain. Thanks @spacenick

## 0.16.3 (January 21, 2016)
- Published under the `test` tag, so not installable via npm latest
- Forgot to add `-test` to the version
- See changelog for 0.16.4 instead

## 0.16.2 (January 8, 2016)

### Bug Fixes
- `<StyleSheet/> Component:`
  - Bind the private method _onChange to the class instance
  - Wrap setState in setTimeout and keep track of isMounted, #500
  - Remove duplicate declaration of componentWillUnmount and move `this._isMounted = true` inside `componentDidMount`
- Clear up docs around StyleRoot props, clear up issues in #496
- Properly prefix keyframes: Use `inline-style-prefixer`â€™s `prefixedKeyframes`, #488
- Ensure unique classname is generated for media query rules (hash on query _and_ ruleCSS string)

## 0.16.1 (January 5, 2016)

### Bug Fixes
- `<StyleRoot>` no longer throws an error on unmount

## 0.16.0 (January 5, 2016)

### New Features
- Server-side rendering for media queries and keyframes!

### Breaking Changes
- To use keyframes and media queries, you must wrap your components in the `<StyleRoot>` component, typically in `<App>`: https://github.com/FormidableLabs/radium/tree/master/docs/api#styleroot-component
- The result of Radium.keyframes is the animation name, and should be assigned to the `animationName` prop: https://github.com/FormidableLabs/radium/tree/master/docs/api#keyframes
- printStyles have been removed, in favor of '@media print' media queries, which are now rendered as CSS so they work correctly: https://github.com/FormidableLabs/radium/tree/master/docs/guides#media-queries

### Bug Fixes
- Don't add extra media query listeners
- Append px to numeric values on properties that don't accept unitless values

### Improvements
- Upgrade `inline-style-prefixer` to version 0.6.2 (Edge support)
- Better error on duplicate keys
- Upgrade to Babel 6
- `<Style>` adds the `scopeSelector` to comma separated selectors
- `<Style>` now accepts `radiumConfig` directly with the `userAgent` field

## 0.15.3 (November 16, 2015)

### Bug Fixes

- Fix `"files"` section in `package.json`, should fix `npm install issues`

## 0.15.2 (November 15, 2015)

### Bug Fixes

- IE vender prefix (ms) is now converted to dash-case correctly (-ms), thanks @PallasKatze, fixes #413
- Super getChildContext is no longer ignored, thanks @richardfickling, fixes #412
- Update to inline-style-prefixer v0.5.1 and changed the userAgent error to a console.warning

## 0.15.1 (November 11, 2015)

### Bug Fixes

- Fix bug where active styles on multiple elements in the same component were not being removed on mouse up, fixes #410

## 0.15.0 (November 11, 2015)

### New Features

- Radium now uses [inline-style-prefixer](https://github.com/rofrischmann/inline-style-prefixer) to do all prefixing. Because `inline-style-prefixer` relies on the userAgent (similar to autoprefixer), it produces the same prefixes on both the client and the server. This is a huge step in making Radium truly universal (see [example](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/radium/blob/master/examples/server.js)). Thanks much to @rofrischmann for putting up with my API suggestions and requests!
- Any Radium component can also be configured at render time via a [`radiumConfig`](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/radium/blob/master/docs/api/README.md#radium). This was mainly required for passing the `userAgent` during a server-side render.

### Breaking Changes

- Style component no longer supports the `prefix` prop. It automatically gets the correct userAgent to pass to the prefixer from `radiumConfig` context

### Bug Fixes

- Radium wrapper now replaces the `style` propType, if defined, with array or object, fixing #396
- Stateless components now support context, thanks @ThomWright
- Static fields on stateless components are now transferred to the Radium wrapper (`defualtProps`, `propTypes`, etc)

### Improvements

- Code has been ES2015-ified: const and let, import/export, fat arrows,
- Code has moved from `modules` to `src`

## 0.14.3 (October 19, 2015)

### Bug Fixes

- camelCasePropsToDashCase handles uppercase first character correctly, fixing #387

## 0.14.2 (October 17, 2015)

### Bug Fixes

- `:active` styles now triggered by space or enter
- Callback `ref`s are now ignored, fixing #346
- Heavy use of media queries no longer causes setState on an unmounted component, fixing #382

### New Features

- Stateless components (function taking props) are now supported

### Improvements

- Updated examples to for React 0.14.0
- Allow replacing the prefixer used by `Radium.keyframes` and `<Style>`

## 0.14.1 (September 15, 2015)

### Bug Fixes

- Don't require object-assign, which wasn't in normal dependencies

## 0.14.0 (September 15, 2015)

### Breaking Changes

- `Config.setMatchMedia` has been replaced by the `matchMedia` field in the config passed to `@Radium` ([see documentation](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/radium/tree/master/docs/api#configmatchmedia))

### New Features

- Plugin system, via the config passed to `@Radium` (see docs for [`config.plugins`](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/radium/tree/master/docs/api#configplugins) and the [plugin API](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/radium/tree/master/docs/api#plugins))
